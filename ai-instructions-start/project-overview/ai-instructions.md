# Project Overview - Tactical Operations Dashboard

## Project Description

You are building a comprehensive command and control system for managing tactical operations. This dashboard will help coordinate field agents, track missions, analyze intelligence, and monitor system infrastructure. The application should have a dark, professional aesthetic that feels like a military command center.

## Learning Objectives

- Design and implement a full-stack web application
- Work with modern web technologies (Next.js, TypeScript, Prisma)
- Understand database design and relationships
- Implement authentication and authorization
- Create responsive and accessible user interfaces
- Handle real-time data updates
- Deploy and maintain a production application

## Data Modeling Exercise

### Entity Identification

**Task**: List all the main entities (nouns) in your tactical operations system.

**Examples to consider:**

- Users (operators, analysts, administrators)
- Agents (field operatives)
- Operations (missions, tasks)
- Intelligence (reports, sources)
- Systems (infrastructure, equipment)
- Activities (logs, events)

### Relationship Mapping

**Task**: Draw the relationships between your entities.

**Questions:**

- Which entities have one-to-many relationships?
- Which entities have many-to-many relationships?
- What happens when a parent entity is deleted?
- How do you handle data integrity and constraints?

## Security Considerations

### Authentication Design

**Questions:**

- What user roles do you need?
- How do you handle password security?
- What session management strategy works best?
- How do you handle user permissions and access control?

### Data Protection

**Questions:**

- What data needs to be encrypted?
- How do you prevent common web vulnerabilities?
- What validation and sanitization is needed?
- How do you handle sensitive information display?

## Performance Planning

### Loading Optimization

**Questions:**

- What can be pre-loaded or cached?
- How do you handle large datasets?
- What loading strategies work best for different page types?
- How do you optimize database queries?

### Real-time Performance

**Questions:**

- How do you handle multiple concurrent users?
- What happens when real-time updates fail?
- How do you manage WebSocket connections?
- What fallback strategies do you need?

## Development Workflow

### Project Setup

**Questions:**
