# User Research Exercise

## Background

The Tactical Operations Dashboard will serve multiple user types within a military/intelligence organization. Understanding these users and their needs is crucial for designing an effective system.

## User Personas

### Colonel Sarah Mitchell (Command Staff)

- **Role**: Senior officer responsible for high-level decision making
- **Technical Skill**: Basic computer literacy
- **Usage Pattern**: 2-3 times daily for briefings and decision making
- **Work Environment**: Command center with multiple displays

### Captain James Rodriguez (Operations Manager)

- **Role**: Personnel responsible for mission planning and execution
- **Technical Skill**: Intermediate computer skills
- **Usage Pattern**: Throughout the day for operational oversight
- **Work Environment**: Operations center with dedicated workstation

### Dr. Emily Chen (Intelligence Analyst)

- **Role**: Staff who process and analyze incoming intelligence reports
- **Technical Skill**: Advanced computer skills
- **Usage Pattern**: Daily for report analysis and intelligence gathering
- **Work Environment**: Intelligence analysis center with specialized tools

### Systems Administrator (Technical Staff)

- **Role**: Technical staff monitoring infrastructure health
- **Technical Skill**: Advanced technical skills
- **Usage Pattern**: Continuous monitoring and maintenance
- **Work Environment**: Technical operations center with monitoring tools

## Discovery Questions

### For Each User Persona:

1. **Primary Goals**

   - What are their main objectives when using the system?
   - What information do they need to make decisions?
   - What actions do they need to take?

2. **Pain Points**

   - What frustrates them about current systems?
   - What takes too long or is too complicated?
   - What information is hard to find or access?

3. **Workflow**

   - How do they currently accomplish their tasks?
   - What tools and systems do they use?
   - What is their typical workday like?

4. **Information Needs**

   - What data do they need to see?
   - How often do they need updates?
   - What level of detail do they require?

5. **Interaction Preferences**
   - How do they prefer to interact with systems?
   - What devices do they use?
   - What are their accessibility needs?

## Analysis Exercise

### Exercise 1: User Journey Mapping

Create a user journey map for one of the personas:

1. **Choose a persona** (Colonel Mitchell, Captain Rodriguez, Dr. Chen, or Systems Admin)
2. **Define a scenario** (e.g., "Responding to a critical alert")
3. **Map the journey**:
   - What triggers their need to use the system?
   - What steps do they take?
   - What information do they need at each step?
   - What decisions do they make?
   - What actions do they take?

### Exercise 2: Requirements Brainstorming

For each persona, brainstorm requirements by asking:

- **Functional Requirements**: What should the system do for this user?
- **Information Requirements**: What data should they see?
- **Usability Requirements**: How should the interface work for them?
- **Performance Requirements**: How fast should the system respond?

### Exercise 3: Priority Analysis

Prioritize requirements for each user:

1. **Must Have** - Essential for the user to do their job
2. **Should Have** - Important but not critical
3. **Could Have** - Nice to have if resources allow
4. **Won't Have** - Not needed for this version

## Documentation Template

### User Requirements Summary

**Persona**: [Name and Role]

**Primary Goals**:

- [Goal 1]
- [Goal 2]
- [Goal 3]

**Key Requirements**:

- **Functional**: [What the system should do]
- **Information**: [What data they need]
- **Usability**: [How the interface should work]
- **Performance**: [How fast it should be]

**Priority Level**: [Must Have/Should Have/Could Have]

**Success Criteria**: [How we'll know we've met their needs]

## Reflection Questions

1. **User Differences**: How do the needs of different user types conflict or complement each other?

2. **Common Patterns**: What requirements are shared across multiple user types?

3. **Priority Conflicts**: How would you resolve conflicts between different user needs?

4. **Implementation Impact**: How do user requirements influence technical decisions?

## Next Steps

After completing this exercise, you should have:

- A clear understanding of each user type and their needs
- Prioritized requirements for each user
- Insights into how to design the system to serve all users effectively

Use these insights to guide your functional requirements analysis in the next section.
