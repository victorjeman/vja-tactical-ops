# Tactical Operations Dashboard - Business Requirements

## Project Overview

We need a comprehensive tactical operations management system that will serve as the central command and control interface for our field operations. The system should provide real-time visibility into agent activities, mission status, intelligence reports, and infrastructure health.

## Business Context

Our organization manages a global network of field operatives conducting various tactical missions. Currently, information is scattered across multiple systems, making it difficult for command staff to maintain situational awareness and make informed decisions. We need a unified dashboard that consolidates all critical information in one place.

## Target Users
