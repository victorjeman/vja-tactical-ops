- **Primary Accent**: Orange (#f97316 / orange-500)
- **Text**: White for primary text, neutral-400 for secondary text
- **Borders**: neutral-700 for subtle borders
- **Status Colors**: Red for critical, yellow for warning, green for success

### Typography

- **Primary Font**: System fonts with monospace for data display
- **Headings**: Bold, uppercase for military aesthetic
- **Data Display**: Monospace font for technical information
- **Body Text**: Clean, readable sans-serif

### Layout

- **Navigation**: Sidebar with collapsible sections
- **Content**: Full-width layouts with proper spacing
- **Cards**: Dark backgrounds with subtle borders
- **Tables**: Compact, data-dense layouts

## Application Architecture

### Page Structure

```
app/
├── page.tsx                    # Dashboard overview
├── agents/
│   └── page.tsx               # Agent management
├── operations/
│   └── page.tsx               # Mission control
├── intelligence/
│   └── page.tsx               # Intelligence reports
├── systems/
│   └── page.tsx               # System monitoring
└── layout.tsx                 # Root layout with navigation
```

### Component Architecture

- **Layout Components**: Navigation, sidebar, main content areas
- **Data Components**: Tables, charts, status indicators
- **Form Components**: Inputs, selects, validation
- **Utility Components**: Loading states, error boundaries

### State Management

- **Server State**: Prisma database queries
- **Client State**: React hooks and context
- **Form State**: React Hook Form
- **Real-time State**: WebSocket connections

## Data Models

### Core Entities

1. **Users**: Authentication and role management
2. **Agents**: Field operatives and their status
3. **Operations**: Missions and their progress
4. **Intelligence**: Reports and threat analysis
5. **Systems**: Infrastructure monitoring
6. **Activities**: Agent action logs
7. **Sessions**: User authentication sessions

### Relationships

- Users can have multiple sessions
- Agents can be assigned to multiple operations
- Operations can have multiple agents
- Agents can have multiple activities
- Intelligence reports are independent entities
- Systems are independent monitoring entities

## Security Considerations

### Authentication

- Session-based authentication with secure tokens
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Secure password handling with bcrypt
- Session expiration and cleanup

### Authorization

- Admin: Full system access
- Operator: Mission and agent management
- Analyst: Intelligence and reporting access
- Viewer: Read-only access to all data

### Data Protection

- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention via Prisma
- XSS protection with proper escaping
- CSRF protection for forms

## Performance Requirements

### Loading Times

- Initial page load: < 2 seconds
- Navigation between pages: < 500ms
- Data updates: < 1 second
- Real-time updates: < 100ms

### Scalability

- Support for 100+ concurrent users
- Handle 1000+ agents and operations
- Real-time updates for 50+ systems
- Efficient database queries with proper indexing

## Development Workflow

### Setup Process

1. Clone repository and install dependencies
2. Set up database with Prisma
3. Configure environment variables
4. Run development server
5. Access application at localhost:3000

### Development Commands

```bash
pnpm dev          # Start development server
pnpm build        # Build for production
pnpm lint         # Run ESLint
pnpm db:generate  # Generate Prisma client
pnpm db:migrate   # Run database migrations
pnpm db:seed      # Seed database
pnpm db:studio    # Open Prisma Studio
```

### Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for utility functions
- Integration tests for API routes
- E2E tests for critical user flows
- Database testing with seeded data

## Deployment

### Environment Setup

- **Development**: Local SQLite database
- **Staging**: PostgreSQL with test data
- **Production**: PostgreSQL with real data

### Deployment Platforms

- **Primary**: Vercel for Next.js hosting
- **Database**: Supabase or Railway for PostgreSQL
- **Monitoring**: Vercel Analytics and logging

### Environment Variables

```env
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-secret-key"
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
```
