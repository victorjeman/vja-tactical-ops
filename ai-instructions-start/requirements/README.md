# Requirements Discovery Workshop

Welcome to the Requirements Discovery phase! In this workshop, you'll learn how to gather and analyze requirements for a complex system like the Tactical Operations Dashboard.

## Workshop Objectives

By the end of this workshop, you should be able to:

- Identify different types of requirements (functional, non-functional, business rules)
- Understand how to gather requirements from stakeholders
- Analyze user needs and translate them into system requirements
- Document requirements in a clear, structured format
- Prioritize requirements based on business value and technical feasibility

## Workshop Structure

This workshop is designed to be hands-on and exploratory. You'll work through several exercises to discover requirements for the Tactical Operations Dashboard:

1. **User Research** - Analyze user personas and their needs
2. **Business Analysis** - Understand the business context and problems
3. **Functional Requirements** - Identify what the system should do
4. **Non-Functional Requirements** - Define how the system should perform
5. **Business Rules** - Establish operational constraints and policies
6. **Success Metrics** - Define how success will be measured

## Getting Started

Each section contains:

- **Background Information** - Context to help you understand the domain
- **Discovery Questions** - Questions to guide your requirements gathering
- **Analysis Exercises** - Hands-on activities to practice requirements analysis
- **Documentation Templates** - Tools to help you structure your findings

## Tips for Success

- **Think like a business analyst** - Focus on understanding the "why" behind requirements
- **Ask probing questions** - Don't accept surface-level answers
- **Consider multiple perspectives** - Different stakeholders have different needs
- **Document everything** - Clear documentation is essential for implementation
- **Validate your understanding** - Confirm requirements with stakeholders

## Workshop Materials

- **User Personas** - Detailed profiles of target users
- **Business Context** - Information about the organization and its needs
- **System Overview** - High-level description of the proposed system
- **Requirements Templates** - Structured formats for documenting requirements

## Next Steps

After completing this workshop, you'll have a comprehensive understanding of the requirements for the Tactical Operations Dashboard. This foundation will guide all subsequent development phases, from database design to user interface development.

Remember: Good requirements are the foundation of successful software development. Take your time to understand the domain and gather comprehensive requirements before moving to implementation.
