# Tactical Operations Dashboard - Workshop Preparation Project

## 🎯 Project Purpose

This repository serves as the **complete reference implementation** for a Tactical Operations Dashboard workshop. The goal is to create comprehensive, natural language instructions that enable students to rebuild this application from scratch using AI assistance.

## 📋 Workshop Context

### What Students Will Learn

Students will participate in a workshop focused on **converting a prototype into a functional application using AI prompts**. They will learn to:

- **Build a complete full-stack application** using AI assistance
- **Design and implement a database schema** with Prisma
- **Create RESTful APIs** with Next.js API routes
- **Develop a modern frontend** with React, TypeScript, and Next.js
- **Implement a comprehensive design system** using shadcn/ui
- **Structure a scalable application architecture**

### Workshop Flow

1. Students receive a repository with only the prototype pages and basic structure
2. They work through `ai-instructions-start/` folder containing exploratory guidance
3. They use AI prompts to implement features step-by-step
4. They reference `ai-instructions-final/` for complete implementation details
5. They build a fully functional Tactical Operations Dashboard

## 🏗️ Current Project State

### What's Already Built

- **Prototype Pages**: Complete UI mockups in `/app/design/`
- **Project Structure**: Next.js 14 with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **Database Schema**: Prisma schema with SQLite
- **Design System**: Comprehensive UI component library

### What's Being Documented

- **Complete implementation steps** in natural language
- **AI prompt strategies** for each development phase
- **Architecture decisions** and reasoning
- **Best practices** for AI-assisted development

## 🎓 Workshop Materials

### For Students (`ai-instructions-start/`)

- **Exploratory guidance** with questions and hints
- **Step-by-step challenges** to encourage problem-solving
- **Learning objectives** for each module
- **AI prompt examples** and strategies

### For Instructors (`ai-instructions-final/`)

- **Complete implementation details** in natural language
- **AI prompt templates** for each development phase
- **Architecture explanations** and design decisions
- **Troubleshooting guides** and common issues

## 🚀 Getting Started

### For Workshop Preparation (Current Phase)

1. Review the prototype pages in `/app/(design)/`
2. Follow the implementation guides in `ai-instructions-final/`
3. Build features step-by-step using AI assistance
4. Document any additional insights or improvements

### For Future Student Workshops

1. Create a new repository with only prototype pages
2. Include `ai-instructions-start/` folder
3. Students work through instructions using AI prompts
4. Reference `ai-instructions-final/` for complete solutions

## 🎯 Application Features

The Tactical Operations Dashboard includes:

- **Agent Network Management**: Track and manage field agents
- **Command Center**: Real-time operations monitoring
- **Intelligence Hub**: Data analysis and reporting
- **Operations Control**: Mission planning and execution
- **Systems Monitoring**: Infrastructure and resource management

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui design system
- **Database**: SQLite with Prisma ORM
- **API**: Next.js API routes
- **Styling**: CSS Modules, Tailwind CSS
- **Development**: ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript

## 📝 Development Philosophy

This project emphasizes:

- **AI-assisted development** as a core skill
- **Natural language instructions** over code examples
- **Problem-solving approach** rather than copy-paste solutions
- **Real-world application** with practical features
- **Scalable architecture** patterns

## 🤝 Contributing

This is a workshop preparation project. The focus is on:
