## Usage

### For AI Agents

1. **Start with project overview** - Understand the complete requirements
2. **Follow the implementation order**:
   - Database setup
   - API layer
   - Frontend components
   - Design system
3. **Use examples as reference** - Each folder contains working examples
4. **Validate each step** - Ensure each phase is complete before moving on

### Implementation Order

1. **Project Overview** (`project-overview/ai-instructions.md`)

   - Read and understand the complete project requirements
   - Review the technology stack and architecture decisions

2. **Database Setup** (`db-setup/ai-instructions.md`)

   - Implement the complete database schema
   - Set up Prisma ORM with multi-file schema
   - Create seed data and database utilities

3. **API Layer** (`api-setup/ai-instructions.md`)

   - Implement Next.js API routes
   - Create CRUD operations for all entities
   - Add authentication and authorization

4. **Frontend Setup** (`frontend-setup/ai-instructions.md`)

   - Build React components and pages
   - Implement navigation and layouts
   - Add data visualization and forms

5. **Design System** (`design-system/ai-instructions.md`)
   - Implement the cyberpunk theme
   - Set up Tailwind CSS configuration
   - Create consistent styling patterns

## Key Features

### Complete Instructions

- Step-by-step implementation guides
- Working code examples
- Validation checklists
- Error handling guidance

### Modular Structure

- Each phase is self-contained
- Clear dependencies between phases
- Reusable examples and patterns

### Production Ready

- Security considerations
- Performance optimization
- Deployment guidance
- Testing strategies

## Validation

After completing each phase, verify:

- [ ] All code compiles without errors
- [ ] Database operations work correctly
- [ ] API endpoints respond properly
- [ ] Frontend components render correctly
- [ ] Design system is consistent
- [ ] All features function as expected

## Next Steps

Once all phases are complete:

1. **Integration Testing** - Test all components together
2. **Performance Optimization** - Optimize queries and rendering
3. **Security Audit** - Review authentication and authorization
4. **Deployment** - Deploy to production environment
5. **Documentation** - Complete user and developer documentation

## Support

These instructions are designed to be comprehensive and self-contained. If you encounter issues:

1. Check the examples in each folder
2. Review the validation checklists
3. Ensure all dependencies are properly installed
4. Verify that each phase is complete before moving to the next

## Repository Structure

This should result in a complete Next.js application with:
